Ain't I professional I got a whole README in here.

Anyways hello, this is Cyvr. This is a pretty basic script that is meant to be easy to use.

In order to get a key for OpenAI you just go here : https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys Then get one. You get like 18 dollars of free credit as of now I think.

Next up is the Discord Bot, which you can get from here : https://discord.com/developers/applications You'll have to create a bot, in the bot section, you just go ahead and check messagecontent intent so that your bot can read messages. Afterwards you will want to plug in your bots ID into this link : https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=IDGOESHERE&scope=bot

Obviously it goes in the IDGOESHERE section, just erase that and put in your bot ID which can be found under General Information as Application ID I think.

And then boom, fill in the stuff in the Python File and you're done. You can set up the personality however you want, oh keep in mind that Memory True will likely burn more money so uh. Yeah. Okay bye, Cyvr, Away!

Or something like that. Yeah bye.
